# HangManGame

The Hangman game in Java is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen word by suggesting letters. The player is given a limited number of incorrect guesses (attempts), and the word is displayed as a series of underscores, with correct guesses filling in the respective positions.

#Key Features:
1. Random Word Selection: A word is chosen randomly from a predefined list.

2. Player Guesses: The player enters one letter per turn, and the game checks if the letter is in the word.

3. Tracking Progress: Correct letters are revealed, while incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.

4. Winning/Losing: The player wins if they guess the entire word before running out of attempts, otherwise they lose.
