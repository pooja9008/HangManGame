The Hangman game in Java is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen word by suggesting letters. The player is given a limited number of incorrect guesses (attempts), and the word is displayed as a series of underscores, with correct guesses filling in the respective positions.

### Key Features:
1. **Random Word Selection**: A word is chosen randomly from a predefined list.
2. **Player Guesses**: The player enters one letter per turn, and the game checks if the letter is in the word.
3. **Tracking Progress**: Correct letters are revealed, while incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.
4. **Winning/Losing**: The player wins if they guess the entire word before running out of attempts, otherwise they lose.
